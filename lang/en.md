## üìñ Usage Instructions

1. Plugin Configuration

    - By default, the .git, .svn, .DS_Store, Thumbs.db, .idea, node_modules, runtime, and sync_config.jsonc files and folders are ignored. You can add others manually.
    - If there is a .gitignore configuration file, it will be used by default to ignore the content to be uploaded.

## Friendly Reminder

1. If you are unable to connect to the server, you can try using other connection tools such as xftp, filezilla, etc. to connect to the server. Once confirmed, you can try connecting again.
2. After uploading files, if the tree menu is not updated, you can use the right-click menu to refresh the file tree.
3. Why is the file not downloaded from the server when reopening it? To save resources, the plugin caches opened files. If you need to update the file, please use the right-click menu and refresh it.
4. Why can't the username or password be decrypted? Your key has been modified. Please re-enter the initial account password and encrypt/decrypt again.
5. Every time you edit the configuration file, all tasks will be automatically stopped. Therefore, please do not modify the configuration file randomly during the upload process.
